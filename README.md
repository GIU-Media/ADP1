# ADP1
Advanced Design Project 1

## Course Aim
Advanced Design Studies are two independent, consecutive, experimental and
interdisciplinary settings that by system, organization and infrastructure, as well as aim differ
from previous course structures; Advanced Design Project I and Project II.
Advanced Design Studies allows the students to shape the study content through their own
personal ideas and encounters.

As prospective design scientists, researchers and creators, students are presented the
opportunity and possibility to state and formulate their own design research topic and
implement their ideas with support from diverse external agencies through potential
cooperation with universities, cultural or research institutions, as well as industries and
business partners. This creates a highly inspirational and dense space for stimulation and
project realization.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
### a. Knowledge and Understanding.
* a.1. Define a specialized knowledge in certain areas of design fields (Graphic, Media
or Product)
* a.2. Identify the process of current research methods and its applications in the design
process.
### b. Intellectual Skills
* b.1. Plan, design and conduct their personal assignment.
* b.2. Classify different types of innovation needed for the process of design development
(Graphic, Media or Product)
b.3. Distinguish between various types of materials and production techniques.
### c. Professional and Practical Skills
* c.1. Prepare autonomously a project to be presented as real like design.
* c.2. Use a project based approach that produces innovative design solutions for both
community and industrial needs.
* c.3. Practice an experience of an inspirational and experimental work-atmosphere.
### d. General and Transferrable Skills
* d.1. Determine how to personally guide and fulfill any time and schedule related design
process tasks.
* d.2. Apply technical skills to real-life design problems flexibly.
